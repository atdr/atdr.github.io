Browsing NASA's gallery of [Astronaut photography of Earth](http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov) today, I came across this gem of an image of the Scilly Isles.

Notice the diffraction of the waves around the small islands in the bottom left? Here's a closer look:

Whilst it's not exactly news to anyone that waves diffract, I thought it was incredibly cool to see such an impressive example of the phenomenon in nature.

[Doing some more digging](https://www.google.co.uk/#q=wave+diffraction+site:eol.jsc.nasa.gov), it seems that [the crew of Apollo 7 took a similar image](http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/metadata/Apollo7.htm) (frame AS7-4-1607 of Magazine N) during their mission. Sadly, [it doesn’t seem like any of the frames from that magazine have been digitised](http://history.nasa.gov/ap07fj/a7images.htm#Magazine_N_). The [only other references](https://www.google.co.uk/#q=%22AS7-4-1607%22) are in [a scientific paper](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/714001.pdf) (§ 2.5 Space Photography) where the image is completely unintelligible and in [a picture book digitised by the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/nasa_techdoc_19710003091/19710003091#page/n63/mode/2up) which doesn’t seem to be [at a high enough resolution](https://archive.org/stream/nasa_techdoc_19710003091/19710003091#page/n64/mode/1up) to see the pattern.

In any case, one diffraction pattern is exciting enough!
