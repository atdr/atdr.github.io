I went along to hear [Dr Marlene Kanga](https://www.raeng.org.uk/policy/partnerships/international-policy-and-development/gcrf-international-development/engineering-a-better-world-caets-2016/conference-theme/speakers/dr-marlene-kanga) speak on '[Engineering a Better, Sustainable World: Advancing the UN 2030 agenda with diverse teams](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/engineering/chemicalengineering/eventssummary/event_8-1-2019-16-24-47)'—and decided on a whim to take some notes.

There's also [an accessible PDF](/assets/files/marlene-kanga-engineering-a-better-sustainable-world.pdf) (using handwriting recognition).
