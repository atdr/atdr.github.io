This academic year, I decided to experiment with Quizlet's [long-term learning feature](https://quizlet.com/en-gb/help/2444098/long-term-learning)[^1] to help me with my revision. It worked pretty well, so now that exams are over and results are out I'm making my notes available to **anyone** to use for **anything**.

I've only made notes for points in the specification that I wasn't confident of, so there are omissions. I did err on the side of caution though, which means there's quite a lot of content.

I've made a folder for each course in which you'll find a set for each of the specification topics.

* [AQA A-Level Physics (7407/7408)](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/aqa-a-level-physics)
  * [Paper 1](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/physics-paper-1)
  * [Paper 2](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/physics-paper-2)
  * [Paper 3](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/physics-paper-3)
* [AQA A-Level Chemistry (7404/7405)](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/aqa-a-level-chemistry)
  * [Paper 1](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/chemistry-paper-1)
  * [Paper 2](https://quizlet.com/andreas_r99/folders/chemistry-paper-2)
  * Paper 3 is synoptic

There are a couple of mistakes in the images which I've tried to remedy in the text. Remember that your teachers and textbooks are much more likely to be correct if there's a conflict with what my notes say.

Don't forget that you can copy and edit the sets as well. Happy studying!

[^1]: Do note that whilst long-term learning is only available to paid [Quizlet Plus](https://quizlet.com/upgrade) members, the [new learn mode](https://quizlet.com/en-gb/help/2762234/studying-with-learn) replicates many of its features. This is what Quizlet says...

    > With Learn, Quizlet builds you an adaptive study plan based on what you need to study and how well you know the material, adjusting questions to make your study sessions harder or easier based on your study patterns. Learn is powered by the new Quizlet Learning Assistant platform, which uses machine learning to process data from millions of anonymous study sessions, and then combines that data with proven techniques from cognitive science.

    ...which sounds pretty similar to...

    > Long-term learning ... tracks what you know and don't know, and you get reminders to study at regular intervals. Questions you don't will be repeated more frequently so you can focus on learning them. If you know the material, you'll only see it every once in a while.

    If you don't need the other features of Quizlet Plus, you'll probably be just fine with the new learn mode.
